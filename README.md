# 2048 Game

This is a simple implementation of the popular game 2048 using HTML, 
CSS, and JavaScript. 
The game is rendered on an HTML5 canvas 
and uses the AngularJS framework for score display.

## How to Play

The objective of the game is to reach the tile 
with the number 2048 by merging tiles with the same number.

  Use the arrow keys ([k] -> up, [j] -> down, [h] -> left, [l] -> right) 
  to move the tiles in the corresponding direction.
  When two tiles with the same number collide, 
  they merge into one tile with the sum of their numbers.
  After each move, 
  a new tile with the number 2 is randomly added to the board.
  The game ends when there are no more valid moves possible 
  or when the 2048 tile is reached.
